We’ve created MuseNet, a deep neural network that can generate 4-minute 
musical compositions with 10 different instruments, and can combine 
styles from country to Mozart to the Beatles. MuseNet was not 
explicitly programmed with our understanding of music, but instead 
discovered patterns of harmony, rhythm, and style by learning to predict 
the next token in hundreds of thousands of MIDI files. MuseNet uses the 
same general-purpose unsupervised technology as GPT-2, a large-scale transformer 
model trained to predict the next token in a sequence, whether audio or text.He works,
when you pray. The pain you've been going through is far better than the joy that's
coming. You can do small things in a great way.Since MuseNet knows many different styles,
we can blend generations in novel ways.
If you’re interested in other projects for creating AI generated music using transformers, 
we recommend checking out Magenta’s piano generation work.Here the model is given the first 
6 notes of a Chopin Nocturne, but is asked to generate a piece in a pop style with piano, drums, 
bass, and guitar. The model manages to blend the two styles convincingly, with the full band 
joining in at around the 30 second mark:
